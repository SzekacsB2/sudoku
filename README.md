# sudoku solver

> made in 2022

<br/>

a simple sudoku solver that uses depth-first search


it visits the empty cells from top-left to bottom-right, filling in digits sequentially, or backtracking when no number is valid
*(so if the puzzle is not well-posed, it only finds the first solution)*

the web app is deployed on github-pages
